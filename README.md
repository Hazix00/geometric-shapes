# Tech C# Interview Project
Requirements:
1.	Visual Code w/ C# or
2.	Visual Studio C#
3.	Object Oriented Programming Knowledge

Objectives:
1.	Utilize Object Oriented Programming to store, retrieve, and manipulate data regarding shapes objects.  
Information regarding the task:  
1).  Create a console project in which we can store, manipulate and retrieve data regarding individual shapes.  
•	Each shape has the following information  

        o	ID - string (unique)  
        o	Width - float  
        o	Height - float  
        o	Amount of Sides - int  
        o	Position [x,y,z] - [float,float,float] array  
        o	Scale - float  
        o	Rotation [x,y,z] - [float,float,float] array  
  
•	Create functions in which we can add/remove/store new shape data, ID must be unique.  
•	Create functions that will allow us to manipulate/edit the values of the position, scale, and rotation of a specific shape id.  
•	Create a function that will output the information of a Shape with a specific ID  
•	Create a function that will allow us to output the information of all the shapes that have been stored.
